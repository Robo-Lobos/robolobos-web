for any kind of record or if perhaps this deserves an entry on the team engineering portfolio: <br>
An idea was had (collaboratively) on Tuesday, October 29, 2024 to create a website for the RoboLobos club. <br>
Jack mentioned that the domain should be "robolobos.club" and so the domain was purchased for exactly $5.17. <br>
Github should handle the rest of logging the coding process for the website so this should be the only manual "logging" I do. <br>
